# Exploring-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-OpenAI-s-Swarm-Framework 🐝 

This repository showcases how to build and manage **collaborative AI agents** using OpenAI's Swarm framework. With Swarm, you can create intelligent, connected agents that work together to tackle tasks, just like a hive of busy bees! 🐝✨

---

## 🐝 What is This About?  
This project demonstrates:  
- 🐝 How to define and configure AI agents with specific tasks.  
- 🐝 How to enable agents to communicate and transfer tasks to one another (handoffs).  
- 🐝 How to use routines to structure workflows for complex tasks.  

---

## Features
- 🐝 **Easy-to-Define Agents**: Simple Python code to create agents with clear instructions and tools.  
- 🐝 **Task Handoffs**: Agents can pass tasks to others for a seamless workflow.  
- 🐝 **Routines**: Structured workflows to guide agents through multi-step processes.  
- 🐝 **Debugging Made Simple**: Track agent decisions and actions with debug mode.

## 🐝 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.10 or later**: Make sure your Python version is up to date.  
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Get your API key from OpenAI [here](https://platform.openai.com).  

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anarojoecheburua/Exploring-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-OpenAI-s-Swarm-Framework.git
   cd Exploring-Multi-Agent-Systems-with-OpenAI-s-Swarm-Framework
   ```
2. Install Swarm and other dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
   ```

## 🐝 Example Scenarios
- A **customer support system** with agents for triage, billing, and technical support.  
- A **task management system** where agents assign and track progress.  
- A **collaborative automation system** that handles complex workflows.
